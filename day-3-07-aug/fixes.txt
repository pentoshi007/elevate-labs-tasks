Day 3 — Analyze Nessus results, decide fixes, and prepare deliverables

Below is a focused action plan and ready-to-use files based on the attached Nessus Essentials scan exports. The priorities are driven by severity, exploitability (EPSS/VPR when available), and vendor guidance.
What the scan shows at a glance

    OS: macOS Sequoia 15.5; Apple released 15.6 with many security fixes, including issues flagged as exploited in the wild.

Browser: Firefox 136.0.1 installed; multiple advisories require upgrading to 141.x (current latest stream is 141.0.3 as of Aug 7, 2025).

    Runtime: Node.js 18.12.1 installed; multiple critical bundles require upgrading to ≥18.20.6[4th report attachment shows advisory table, see plugins].

    DB: MySQL 8.0.36 installed; Oracle CPUs require upgrading to ≥8.0.42/8.0.43, with interim advisories including January and July cycles[2nd report PDF “Patch Report” plus plugin details].

    VMware Fusion: 13.6.0 installed; VMware advisory requires 13.6.3 for HGFS info disclosure (CVE-2025-22226)[2nd report PDF shows VMSA-2025-0004].

    mDNS services visible (AirPlay/RAOP) via Bonjour; consider limiting advertisement on untrusted networks[scan HTML list].

Key vendor facts to justify upgrades:

    macOS Sequoia 15.6 released July 29, 2025 with numerous fixes (WebKit, Security, kernel-adjacent components). Several tracked by govCERT/CERT advisories urge immediate update due to active exploitation like CVE-2025-6558 tied to Chrome’s ANGLE/GPU path also affecting macOS release bundles.

Firefox 141 line is the current stable; 141.0.3 released Aug 7, 2025.

    These updates align with Nessus “Patch Report” recommendations.

Immediate next steps (in order)

    Update macOS to 15.6

    Reason: Apple’s 15.6 fixes many CVEs; CERT/government advisories highlight active exploitation and recommend immediate patching.

How: System Settings > General > Software Update > Update to macOS Sequoia 15.6.

    Update Firefox to 141.x (current latest 141.0.3)

    Reason: Multiple critical advisories in the 136–141 window; latest stream is 141.0.3 (Aug 7, 2025).

How (Mac App Store users): Open App Store > Updates > Firefox.

How (direct): Download current installer from Mozilla and replace Firefox.app.

    Update Node.js from 18.12.1 to ≥18.20.6 (LTS)

    Reason: Multiple critical bundles (2023–2025) require 18.20.6+ per Nessus plugins; brings fixes across HTTP/2, permission model, crypto, etc. (scan shows many impacted CVEs).

    How (Homebrew):

        brew update

        brew install node@18

        brew link --overwrite --force node@18

        Confirm: node -v should report v18.20.6+.

    Update MySQL from 8.0.36 to ≥8.0.43 (latest July 2025 CPU track)

    Reason: “Patch Report” lists multiple CPUs; jumping to the latest 8.0.43 satisfies 8.0.40/41/42 advisories and July 2025 CPU[scan HTML “Patch Report” table and plugin outputs].


    How (Homebrew if used):

        brew update

        brew upgrade mysql

        Verify: mysqld --version or mysql --version should show 8.0.43.

    Update VMware Fusion from 13.6.0 to 13.6.3

    Reason: VMSA-2025-0004 HGFS information disclosure (CVE-2025-22226) with known-exploited tags calls for 13.6.3[scan PDF plugin 222492 and table].

    How: VMware Fusion > Check for Updates or download latest 13.6.3 installer and replace app.

    Reduce local service exposure (mDNS/Bonjour)

    Reason: mDNS reveals AirPlay/RAOP service details; on untrusted networks, disable or limit.

    How (macOS):

        System Settings > General > Sharing: turn off AirPlay Receiver if not needed.

        For stricter environments, block inbound UDP:5353 on untrusted interfaces (via firewall or network profile).

    Reboot, then re-run Nessus authenticated scan

    Reason: Validate remediation and clear “Patch Report” actions.

Commands for MacBook Air M1 (record these in notes/commands.txt)

    System info (IP and mask context):

        ipconfig getifaddr en0

        ifconfig en0

    Update stack:

        softwareupdate --install --all (optional; UI method preferred for major version)

        brew update && brew upgrade

        brew install node@18 && brew link --overwrite --force node@18

        node -v

        mysql --version

    Limit services (examples):

        System Settings > General > Sharing: disable services not used (AirPlay Receiver, Screen Sharing, Remote Login).

    Re-scan:

        Use Nessus UI to relaunch the saved scan.

What should change after fixes

    Critical Firefox findings (plugins 233646/238071/240333/242556) should clear once Firefox reports 141.0.3.

macOS 15.x < 15.6 item (plugin 243030) should clear after the OS upgrade.

Node.js critical bundles (171595/177518/179692/183390/190856/192945/201969/214404) should clear once node -v is ≥18.20.6.

MySQL CPU advisories (202616/202620/214534/242314/242313) should resolve at 8.0.43.

VMware Fusion HGFS (222492) clears at 13.6.3.
