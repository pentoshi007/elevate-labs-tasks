## 🎓 Interview Questions & Answers

### Q1: What is vulnerability scanning and how does it differ from penetration testing?
**Answer:** Vulnerability scanning is an automated security assessment process that systematically identifies, classifies, and prioritizes security weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications. It uses databases of known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and configuration checks to detect potential security issues. **Key differences from penetration testing:** **Scope** - scanning is broad and automated, pentesting is targeted and manual; **Depth** - scanning identifies potential vulnerabilities, pentesting validates and exploits them; **Methodology** - scanning uses automated tools and signatures, pentesting uses human expertise and creative attack paths; **Output** - scanning provides vulnerability inventories, pentesting provides proof-of-concept exploits and business risk assessment; **Frequency** - scanning is continuous/regular, pentesting is periodic and project-based.

### Q2: How do vulnerability scanners detect security issues?
**Answer:** Vulnerability scanners use multiple detection techniques: **Version Fingerprinting** - identifying software versions and comparing against vulnerability databases; **Banner Grabbing** - analyzing service responses to determine software and version information; **Configuration Analysis** - checking system settings against security baselines; **Credentialed Scanning** - using authentication to perform deeper inspection of installed software and patches; **Network Probing** - testing for open ports, services, and protocol implementations; **Signature Matching** - comparing system characteristics against known vulnerability patterns; **Plugin Architecture** - using specialized detection modules for specific vulnerabilities or software. Modern scanners combine these techniques with threat intelligence feeds and exploit databases for comprehensive coverage.

### Q3: What is CVSS and how is it used in vulnerability management?
**Answer:** CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities on a scale of 0.0 to 10.0. It consists of three metric groups: **Base Metrics** - intrinsic characteristics that don't change (Attack Vector, Attack Complexity, Privileges Required, User Interaction, Scope, Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability Impact); **Temporal Metrics** - characteristics that change over time (Exploit Code Maturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence); **Environmental Metrics** - characteristics specific to the user's environment (Modified Base Metrics, Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability Requirements). **Usage in vulnerability management:** prioritizing remediation efforts, allocating security resources, communicating risk to stakeholders, establishing SLAs for patch deployment, and comparing vulnerabilities across different systems and environments.

### Q4: How do you prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation?
**Answer:** Vulnerability prioritization requires a multi-factor approach: **Severity Assessment** - CVSS base scores and impact ratings; **Exploitability** - availability of public exploits, EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) scores, known exploitation in the wild; **Asset Criticality** - business importance, data sensitivity, system exposure; **Environmental Factors** - network segmentation, compensating controls, user access patterns; **Remediation Complexity** - patch availability, system dependencies, downtime requirements; **Threat Intelligence** - active campaigns targeting specific vulnerabilities, industry-specific threats. **Prioritization framework:** Critical vulnerabilities with public exploits on internet-facing systems get immediate attention, followed by high-severity issues on critical assets, then medium-severity vulnerabilities based on business risk and remediation feasibility.

### Q5: What are common vulnerabilities found on personal computers?
**Answer:** Personal computers commonly exhibit several vulnerability categories: **Outdated Software** - operating systems, browsers, plugins, and applications missing security patches; **Weak Authentication** - default passwords, no multi-factor authentication, password reuse; **Unnecessary Services** - unused network services, file sharing, remote access tools; **Insecure Configurations** - disabled security features, overly permissive settings, weak encryption; **Browser Security** - outdated browsers, insecure plugins, malicious extensions; **Network Exposure** - open ports, unsecured wireless connections, lack of firewall protection; **Malware Susceptibility** - missing antivirus, outdated definitions, risky user behavior; **Physical Security** - unencrypted storage, unlocked screens, unsecured devices. Regular updates, security software, and user education are key mitigation strategies.

### Q6: How often should vulnerability scans be performed?
**Answer:** Scan frequency depends on the environment and risk tolerance: **Personal Systems** - monthly scans for comprehensive assessment, weekly for critical systems, immediately after major software installations or configuration changes; **Enterprise Networks** - weekly to bi-weekly for production systems, daily for internet-facing assets, continuous monitoring for critical infrastructure; **Development Environments** - before each deployment, after significant code changes, integrated into CI/CD pipelines; **Compliance Requirements** - quarterly for PCI DSS, annually for some frameworks, but best practices recommend more frequent scanning; **Event-Driven Scanning** - after security incidents, new vulnerability disclosures, system changes, or threat intelligence updates. The key is balancing security visibility with operational impact and resource constraints.

### Q7: What is a false positive in vulnerability scanning and how do you reduce them?
**Answer:** A false positive is when a vulnerability scanner reports a security issue that doesn't actually exist or isn't exploitable in the specific environment. **Common causes:** version detection errors, configuration misinterpretation, network conditions affecting scans, outdated vulnerability signatures. **Reduction strategies:** **Credentialed Scanning** - use authentication to get accurate software inventories; **Regular Updates** - keep scanner plugins and vulnerability databases current; **Scan Tuning** - customize policies for specific environments and technologies; **Manual Verification** - validate critical findings through manual testing; **Baseline Establishment** - create environment-specific baselines to filter known false positives; **Scanner Selection** - choose tools appropriate for the target environment; **Continuous Improvement** - track false positive rates and adjust scanning policies accordingly. Credentialed scans typically reduce false positives by 60-80% compared to unauthenticated scans.

### Q8: How do you validate that vulnerability remediation was successful?
**Answer:** Remediation validation requires multiple verification methods: **Re-scanning** - run the same vulnerability scan to confirm issues are resolved; **Version Verification** - manually check software versions match patched levels; **Configuration Review** - verify security settings were properly applied; **Functional Testing** - ensure systems operate correctly after patches; **Penetration Testing** - attempt to exploit previously identified vulnerabilities; **Log Analysis** - review system logs for patch installation success; **Compliance Checking** - verify remediation meets regulatory requirements; **Documentation Updates** - update asset inventories and security baselines; **Metrics Tracking** - measure reduction in vulnerability counts and risk scores. **Best practices:** wait 24-48 hours after patching before re-scanning to allow for system updates, maintain remediation tracking databases, and establish clear success criteria before beginning remediation efforts.
