As part of Day 6 of my Elevate Labs internship, I researched common password attacks. Here's what I learned:

    Brute Force Attack:
    This is when attackers try every possible combination of characters to guess a password. They use automated tools that can try thousands or millions of combinations per second. It's especially effective against short or simple passwords because there are fewer possibilities to check. For example, a 6-character password with only lowercase letters has about 308 million combinations, which modern computers can crack quickly.

    Dictionary Attack:
    This involves using a list (or "dictionary") of common words, phrases, or previously leaked passwords to guess someone's password. Attackers start with things like "password," "123456," or variations like "letmein123." It's faster than brute force because it doesn't try random combinationsâ€”it focuses on likely guesses. If your password is based on a real word or something predictable, it's vulnerable.

Other common attacks I came across include:

    Phishing: Tricking people into giving away their passwords through fake emails or websites.

    Keylogging: Malware that records keystrokes to steal passwords as you type them.

How Password Complexity Affects Security:
Password complexity makes a big difference in defending against these attacks. Longer passwords (like 12+ characters) exponentially increase the number of possible combinations, making brute force attacks take way longer sometimes years or centuries with strong enough complexity. Adding uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols adds even more variety, which slows down both brute force and dictionary attacks. For dictionary attacks, avoiding common words or patterns (like using random strings instead of "password1") is key. Overall, complex passwords force attackers to spend more time and resources, often making the attack not worth it.
