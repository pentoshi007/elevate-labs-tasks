Notable Packets/Events

    TCP three-way handshakes on port 443:

        SYN from 10.102.139.x → remote:443

        SYN/ACK from remote → 10.102.139.x

        ACK completing connection

    TLS handshake sequences:

        Client Hello from 10.102.139.x

        Server Hello, Change Cipher Spec, Encrypted Extensions, Application Data

    Application Data over TLS after handshake (encrypted payloads)

    Connection teardowns:

        FIN, ACK sequences between 10.102.139.x and remote 443 endpoints

        Occasional “TCP Previous segment not captured” noted

    DNS traffic:

        Standard query for a1068.dscr.akamai.net (and other domains)

        Standard query responses from DNS server 10.94.2.111

    Local broadcast/announcement traffic:

        NBNS/Browser “Host Announcement” frames to 10.102.143.255

        UDP broadcasts from 10.102.137.x/10.102.139.x to 10.102.143.255 ports 54915 etc.

    SSHv2 encrypted packets:

        13.232.131.249 ↔ 10.102.139.8 (server and client encrypted payloads on TCP/22)

Ports Observed

    443/tcp (HTTPS)

    53/udp (DNS)

    22/tcp (SSH)

    137–139/udp (NBNS/NetBIOS/Browser announcements)

    High ephemeral UDP/TCP source ports (e.g., 54915, 61522, 61530, etc.)

Key Observations

    Majority of traffic is HTTPS to CDN/edge hosts (Akamai), indicating normal web activity.

    Successful TCP handshakes and clean FIN/ACK terminations; a few missing segments noted but streams continue, suggesting transient packet loss or late start of capture.

    TLS negotiations complete with Server Hello and cipher changes, followed by encrypted application data.

    Internal DNS resolving external CDN hostnames; responses received without errors.

    Routine LAN broadcast traffic present (NBNS/Host Announcements).

    SSHv2 encrypted traffic observed to external IP 13.232.131.249, indicating an active or recent SSH session.

Security Notes

    No obvious plaintext credentials or HTTP data visible; traffic predominantly encrypted (TLS/SSH).

    Presence of “TCP Previous segment not captured” indicates not all packets were captured; for forensics, consider longer capture or capture filter adjustments.

    Verify SSH destination (13.232.131.249) is expected; otherwise, investigate authorized sessions.
