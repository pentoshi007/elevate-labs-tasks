Routing & IP Details
	•	Sender IP: 103.167.154.120 (Indonesia, not owned by Microsoft).
	•	“Received-SPF” line shows none; nisihfjoz.co.uk is not an authorized sender for microsoft.com.

	•	Microsoft Anti-Spam BCL: 5 (high bulk/spam likelihood).
	•	`x-sid-result: FAIL` and `x-sid-pra: NO-REPLY@MICROSOFT.COM` confirm spoofing.
Other Red Flags

    Summary:
Every major authentication test fails, the sender IP is foreign to Microsoft infrastructure, and spam scores are at their highest. These technical indicators confirm the message is phishing.
