Browser Extension Security Research:

How Malicious Extensions Work:
- Data harvesting: Collecting browsing history, passwords, personal information
- Ad injection: Modifying web pages to insert malicious advertisements
- Cryptocurrency mining: Using browser resources for unauthorized mining
- Session hijacking: Stealing authentication tokens and cookies
- Keylogging: Recording keystrokes to capture sensitive information

Common Attack Vectors:
- Social engineering: Disguising malware as useful tools
- Permission escalation: Requesting minimal permissions initially, then expanding
- Update mechanisms: Pushing malicious updates to previously safe extensions
- Typosquatting: Creating extensions with names similar to popular ones

Protection Mechanisms:
- Mozilla's review process for Firefox Add-ons
- Sandboxing: Limiting extension access to browser APIs
- Permission systems: Granular control over extension capabilities
- User reviews and ratings systems
- Automatic security scanning

Notable Security Cases:
- Web of Trust (WOT): Collected and sold users' browsing data
- Hola VPN: Used users' devices as exit nodes without consent
- Multiple Chrome extensions: Sold to malicious actors who updated them with malware
- Adblock Plus controversy: Allowing "acceptable ads" for payment

Red Flags for Suspicious Extensions:
- Excessive permissions not related to functionality
- Unknown or unverified publishers
- Poor reviews or sudden negative feedback
- Requests for financial or personal data access
- Very few users despite being available for long periods
